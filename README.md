This repository contains a basic C code implementation that demonstrates the concept of a loader in an operating systems course. The code is designed to be a simple educational example, illustrating how a loader works in the context of an operating system.
The loader is a crucial component of an operating system, responsible for loading programs or other executable code into memory for execution. This example code showcases the fundamental steps and processes involved in loading a program, including tasks such as:

Reading the executable file from disk
Parsing the executable file format (e.g., ELF, PE)
Allocating memory segments for the program
Copying the program code and data into memory
Resolving external dependencies (e.g., shared libraries)
Setting up the initial program state (e.g., stack, registers)
Transferring control to the program's entry point

While this implementation is not a full-fledged production-ready loader, it aims to provide a clear and understandable example of the core loader functionality.
